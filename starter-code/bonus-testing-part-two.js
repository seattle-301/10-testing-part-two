  ---------------------- Part Two! Hungry Lion ----------------------------
  ======================================================================
   As long as the lion is well-fed, he doesn't care too much of the
   humans that pass through. Unfortunately, the new caretaker is a little
   absent-minded.

   The lion needs 4 meals per day on average to stay happy. You're going to
   figure out how many days it took before the lion decided to supplement his
   diet with the caretaker.

     Write at least one more test function that calls assert to test

     based on the number of days available in the array. */

   Cycle through the days in mealsPerDay. Log the cumulative average
   meals/day the lion ate since the new caretaker started.
   tooHungryDay should be equal to the day the lion started

   meals) Remember: humans count days starting at 1!
