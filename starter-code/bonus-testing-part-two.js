   As long as the lion is well-fed, he doesn't care too much of the
   humans that pass through. Unfortunately, the new caretaker is a little
   absent-minded.

   The lion needs 4 meals per day on average to stay happy. You're going to
   figure out how many days it took before the lion decided to supplement his
   diet with the caretaker.
